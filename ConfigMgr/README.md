## Power of The Shell - Configuration Manager
> This Repository is for random Configuration Manager/SCCM scripts I have created for one task or another.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
These scripts are SCCM based so need to be ran from a computer that has the SCCM Console or the Module installed.
