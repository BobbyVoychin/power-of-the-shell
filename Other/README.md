# Power of The Shell - Other
> This Repository is for random scripts I have created for one task or another, that doesn't fully fit in another folder.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
The requirements for each script should be listed in the scripts #requires field.
If the scripts in here become a bit unwieldy I may move them to another folder or category at any time.
