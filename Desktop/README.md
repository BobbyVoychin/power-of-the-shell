## Power of The Shell - Desktop
> This Repository is for random Windows Desktop scripts I have created for one task or another.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
These scripts could be anything from App-V to WMI calls. The requirements for each script should be listed in the scripts #requires field.
