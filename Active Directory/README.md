## PowerofTheShell - Active Directory
> This Repository is for random Active Directory PowerShell (Windows based) scripts I have created for one task or another, these will be either directly Active Directory based or based on any Active Directory Domain Service service.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
These scripts are Active Directory based so need the Windows Remote Administration Tools installed or the correct Role of the server configured, installed.
