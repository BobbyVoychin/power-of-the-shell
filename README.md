# Power of The Shell
> This Repository is for random Knicks and knacks - in relation to PowerShell (Windows based) scripts I have created for one task or another.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
