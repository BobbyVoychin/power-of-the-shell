# Power Of The Shell
> This Repository is for random Knicks and knacks - in relation to PowerShell scripts I have created for one task or another. I am quite happy if you fork any of the projects - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator.
