## Power of The Shell - Operations Manager/SCOM
> This Repository is for random SCOM scripts I have created for one task or another.

> I get inspiration and help from the PowerShell community so willing to give back in return, also happy if you fork any of the files - or recommend improvements.

## Usage example

Unless specified otherwise, every script can usually be ran directly from Powershell or the PowerShell ISE as Administrator. 
These scripts usually would be ran on the SCOM server or remotely using PSSession.
